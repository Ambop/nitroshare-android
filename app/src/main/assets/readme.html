            Thank you for helping test NitroShare for Android.
            This guide provides useful information for using the application.
        </p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To send a transfer, use the share button in another application and select the "Send with NitroShare" item
            </li>
            <li>
                To receive a transfer, simply initiate one from another device, such as a PC
            </li>
            <li>
                To adjust settings, such as this device's name on the network, use the settings menu item in the upper-right corner
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            The application is still in its early stages.
            As such, certain features that will be included in the final release are absent or incomplete in the beta builds.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It is not possible to send a directory due to the way third-party applications share data with NitroShare.
                A simple file manager will be added to NitroShare to work around this limitation.
            </li>
        </ul>
